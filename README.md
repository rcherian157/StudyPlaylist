# StudyPlaylist
This programs aims to create different types of iterators to play through a collection of
songs in different orders. So, one type of iterator i.e Playlist plays the songs from the first
song to the last song and the other type of iterator i.e ReversePlaylist plays the songs from the
last song to the first song. For this assignment, doubly linked lists, iterable, and the
iterator interfaces were the tools primarily used.
